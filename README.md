# Overview
This README is outdated.

SPECTRE is a program verification tool that parses programs and
produces first-order logic problems in TPTP syntax. It can be used to
generate loop invariants, or to verify that a loop satisfies a given
specification, without user-supplied invariants.

## What programs may be used as input?

The programs must be given in a dedicated guarded command
language. Some key features of the language are:
- at every iteration, the first command whose guard evaluates to true
  is exectuted
- if a command is executed, all its assignments are performed **in parallel**
- if no guard is true, or if the optional loop condition is false, the
  loop is exited
- programs are made of a single loop, but you can specify
  pre-conditions to describe all possibles program states at the
  beginning of the execution
- you can specify post-conditions, which are used only in
  'verification' mode

See the example programs on the repository for more details.

## How to use the generated problems?

There are two modes:

- the *verification mode* generates a first-order problem in which the
  post-condition is essentially the conjecture, and the hypotheses
  describe the semantics of the loop. Use a first-order theorem prover
  to solve the generated problem: if successful, the loop satisfies
  its specification.
- the *invariant generation mode* generates a set of formulas that
  describe the semantics of the loop. You can then use a
  symbol-eliminating first-order theorem prover to generate
  consequences of these formulas, which are guaranteed to be
  invariants of the loop.

## What first-order theorem prover should I use?

Any prover that supports TFF (typed first-order) syntax can be used to
solve problems generated by the 'verification' mode. Depending on the
options and the input program, the TPTP problem may also contain some
theories (i.e. arrays) or FOOL formulas, where Boolean terms and
predicate are treated similarly. All of these features are supported
by Vampire.

Problems generated in 'invariant generation' mode rely on a symbol
elimination mechanism. As of today, Vampire is the only first-order
theorem able to perform symbol elimination. To use symbol elimination
in Vampire, run
```
$ vampire --show_symbol_elimination on <file>
```
The clauses output by Vampire are loop invariants.


# Building the executable

To build the executable you will need to have Make, Bison and Flex
installed. From the main directory, simply run
```
$ make
```
to build the executable 'spectre'. Optionally, run
```
$ make clean
```
to get rid of object files afterwards.
