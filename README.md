# Overview

INVGEN is a program verification tool that parses programs and
produces first-order logic problem in TPTP syntax. It can be used to
verify loops without 

## What programs may be used as input?

The programs must be given in a dedicated guarded command
language. Some key features of the language are:
- at every iteration, the first command whose guard evaluates to true
  is exectuted
- if a command is executed, all its assignments are performed IN PARALLEL
- if no guard is true, or if the optional loop condition is false, the
  loop is exited
- programs are made of a single loop, but you can specify
  pre-conditions to describe all possibles program states at the
  beginning of the execution
- you can specify post-conditions, which are used only in
  'verification' mode

Check the example programs on the repository for more details.

## How to use the generated problems?

There are two modes:

- the 'verification' mode generates a first-order problem in which the
  post-condition is essentially the conjecture, and the hypotheses
  describe the semantics of the loop. Use a first-order theorem prover
  to solve the generated problem: if successful, your loop satisfies
  its specification.
- the 'invariant generation' mode generates a set of formulas that
  describe the semantics of the loop. You can then use a
  symbol-eliminating first-order theorem prover to generate
  consequences of these formulas, which are guaranteed to be
  invariants of the loop.


## What first-order theorem prover should I use?

Any prover that support TFF (typed first-order) syntax can be used to
solve problems generated by the 'verification' mode.

Problems generated in 'invariant generation' mode rely on a symbol
elimination mechanism. As of today, Vampire is the only first-order
theorem able to perform symbol elimination.


# Building the executable

To build the executable you will need to have Make, Bison and Flex
installed. From the main directory, simply run
```
$ make
```
to build the executable 'invgen'. Optionally, run
```
$ make clean
```
to get rid of object files afterwards.
