// same as init, but loop condition i < alength simplified to i != alength (which should make it trivial to conclude that i^n = alength)

int [] a;
int i, alength, v;

requires i == 0;
requires 0 <= alength;

ensures forall int j, 0 <= j & j < alength ==> a[j] == v;

while (i != alength) do
:: true -> a[i] = v; i = i + 1;
