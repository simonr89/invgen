// same program as init, but different postcondition: It seems that init with the timepoints-encoding can't derive the clause i^n = alength^n. Therefore one can try to prove this postcondition separately. Surprisingly, in such case Vampire finds a proof. 

int [] a;
int i, alength, v;

requires i == 0;
requires 0 <= alength;

ensures i == alength;

while (i < alength) do
:: true -> a[i] = v; i = i + 1;
