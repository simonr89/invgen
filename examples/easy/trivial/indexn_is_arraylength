// example which shows that we need the requirement that array-lengths are nonnegative: If we remove the precondition "0 <= alength", then neither the standard-encoding nor the timepoint encoding is able to prove the postcondition "i == alength".

int i, alength;

requires i == 0;
requires 0 <= alength;

ensures i == alength;

while (i < alength) do
:: true -> i = i + 1;
