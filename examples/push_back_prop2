// similar to copy, but keeps track of the size of a and asserts the property with respect to the size of a

int [] a, b;
int i, alength, blength;

requires alength == 0;
requires 0 <= blength;
requires i == 0;

ensures forall int j, 0 <= j & j < alength ==> a[j] == b[j];

while (i < blength) do
:: true -> a[i] = b[i]; alength = alength + 1; i = i + 1;
